- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevFJones7.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a front-end web developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML (a tortorously slow learner unfortunately)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on HTML, CSS, JS and everything front-end web development.
- 📫 How to reach me? A simple DM would do.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm attempting to re-skill in the IT industry all by lonesome *insert massive feelings of trepidation and impostor syndrome*.
